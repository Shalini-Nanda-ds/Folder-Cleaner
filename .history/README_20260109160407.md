# 🚀 Folder Cleaner Automation

🧹 **Messy folders? Not anymore!**  
This Python automation script helps organize messy folders by automatically arranging files based on their file extensions.

Think of it as your **digital housekeeper 🤖✨** that keeps your folders clean and organized with minimal effort.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

📂 Scans all files inside a target folder  
🔍 Detects file extensions automatically  
🗂️ Creates category folders if they don’t exist  
🚚 Moves files into their respective folders  
❓ Handles unknown extensions safely as **Others**  
🛡️ Skips files if the same file already exists in the destination  

---

## 🧩 File Organization Logic

- 📄 `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.ipynb` → **Documents**
- 🖼️ `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.webp` → **Images**
- 🎵 `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg` → **Audio**
- 🎬 `.mp4` → **Videos**
- 📦 `.zip` → **Archives**
- ⚙️ `.exe`, `.ini`, `.winmd` → **System**
- ❓ Anything else → **Others**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📁 `os` module – file & folder handling  
- 🚚 `shutil` module – moving files safely

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shalini-Nanda-ds/Folder-Cleaner.git
Go to the project folder and run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script runs in TEST_MODE by default:

Files are NOT moved

You can safely see what will happen

To actually move files, update in main.py:

python
Copy code
TEST_MODE = False
🛡️ Duplicate Handling (Design Decision)
Initially, files were organized without checking for duplicates, which caused some folders to contain repeated files.

Instead of modifying the main organization logic, a separate recovery script was introduced.

🔄 Duplicate Recovery Script: duplicate_recovery.py
What This Script Does
Scans all existing folders (Documents, Images, Audio, etc.)

Detects files with the same name inside the same folder

Keeps the original file in place

Moves extra copies into a _DUPLICATES folder

❌ Does NOT delete any files

🔁 Fully reversible and safe

Why a Separate Script?
✔ Keeps the main script simple
✔ Avoids accidental data loss
✔ Helps fix past issues without breaking current logic
✔ Reflects real-world engineering practices

🧠 Design Philosophy
One script = one responsibility

Main script focuses only on organization

Recovery logic is handled separately

Safety-first approach using TEST_MODE

🌱 Future Improvements
Content-based duplicate detection

Logging and reporting

Config file for easy customization

Command-line arguments support

✨ Final Note
This project was built while learning Python through hands-on practice.
The focus is not only on automation, but also on writing safe, clean, and maintainable code.

Happy cleaning! 🧹🚀
